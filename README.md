# PynnyAndroid
Pynny is an Android port of my budgeting application for everday consumers. The purpose of this app is to 
provide users a simple way of recording transactions and managing their budget goals across several 
sources of currency flow ("wallets") through the use of "categories." The data storage used is SQLite and 
can thus be stored directly on the device and easily shared.   

This app was developed over the course of my Fall 2017 semester at UA Little Rock for my final project in 
CPSC 4367: Mobile Applications Development.
